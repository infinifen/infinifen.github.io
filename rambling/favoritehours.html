            <p>it's getting dark now. people start going out onto the streets and partying, but i'm not interested in
                that.
                you can take beautiful photos of the gradient-like sky with just your phone camera and a little pro mode fuckery.
                i personally love going out to more residential areas and just wandering around surrounded by the light
                from old sodium-powered lamps and no goddamn people!!!!</p>

            <p>it's basically the middle of the night. not mathematically, but from a human perspective. there's a good
                chance everybody else at home is asleep and you get to have some peace
                and be yourself and talk to people and stuff. other than that, there's not a lot of interesting stuff to
                be done as i don't really want to go out alone at 2am.</p>

            <p>okay, <i>now</i> everybody is asleep. except if you're one of those people who have to travel a
                moderately
                long distance to your
                job that starts at 6am but for my convenience i shall remain blissfully unaware of your existence
                (sorry). it's getting bright again and you could get even more sky gradienty shots if you went out. <br>
                on the other hand though... it's getting bright. the rising sun leads towards the day - the time you
                need to spend being an approX³ךיon±�× fיBurs¯¶f¶▓████

            <p>as much as i can dislike the day, there is something nice about those sunshine-filled spring
                mornings.</p>
