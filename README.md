this is just some of my dumb things i do
don't expect anything nice
- clicker: an old project i abandoned a long time ago, don't even bother going there
- tabliczkajs: some multiplication table trainer i guess
- sbevespeak: there is a 99.9999% chance you don't know what is this about
you don't need to
all you need to know is that it inserts commas into text randomly
- superfarmer: some polish board game but now in your browser with a hard to understand UI and in polish
- durmoll: another thing the purpose of you won't know, if you know something about music you can try but
the notation can be way different from what you use, sorry
